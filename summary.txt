Leanrning objectives:
1. Go throught the typical machine learning work flow
2. Learn to use predctive modeling via logistics regression model and decision tree model
3. Learn how to fine-tune a logistic model via hyperparameter tuning and L2 regularization
4. Learn to use sklearn package, including model selection, metrics, logistics regression, grid search and decision tree

Typical ML workflows: 
Phase 1: EDA & Visualization
data cleaning-eliminating null values & duplicates
pay attention to value counts and find out if each category is unique
pay attention to the data types, and whether more relevant data can be extracted
visualize the overall dataset to see if it is representative of real-world data
visualize positive examples (for ML) to see if there are patterns worth exploring
build confusion matrix - how to interpret them

Phase 2: regression modeling(supervised learning)
need to check if dataset is imbalanced
need to find which variables are relevant for ML training
need to normalize all numetic variables
need to convert all catgotical variables into dummy variables
fine turning- use grid search for the best estimators
find the correct metrics - recall or precision & type II errors
find out the major features by finding coefficients - implement L2 regularization
